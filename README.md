 ## Global Weight Detection Using YOLOV5
 
 ### I solved a kaggle ongoing problem. that's link is https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/overview
 
 ### What I did
 1. At first I divided dataset into 2 parts, One for train and another for validation. 
 2. Then I opened a YAML file and write the path of the train and validation data. I also written total number of class
 3. Finally I run this program using terminal.
